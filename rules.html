<h2>Rules & Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Teams start at the entry page and proceed through questions 1 to 12.</li>
<li>Each question page contains a riddle. Solve it to reach a campus location that has a printed QR code.</li>
<li>Open the scanner on the question page and scan that QR code to unlock the next question.</li>
<li>Do not tamper with QR codes. Respect campus property and safety rules.</li>
<li>Use your phone camera or the built-in scanner. If the scanner fails, upload the QR image from your gallery.</li>
</ol>
<p class="muted">Note: For testing you can scan the sample QR on q1 in dev mode.</p>
